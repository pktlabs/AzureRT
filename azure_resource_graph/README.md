## Overview  
The `azure_resource_graph.py` script is designed to build a graph-view through Node-Edge relationships across multiple Azure resources to help shed light on potential blindspots, such as Storage Account access control, visualized with `Sigma.js`.

## Prerequisites  
To use this script, you need the following:

- **az cli**: Authenticate with `az login` before launching `azure_resource_graph.py`.
- **Azure RBAC Reader**: The identity to use with the `az cli` requires atleast "Reader" on the subscriptions in-scope.

## Usage

   ```bash
   # 1. Clone or download this repository. 
   git clone https://github.com/fjodoin/AzureRT.git

   # 2. Change into the according directory.
   cd ./AzureRT/azure_resource_graph
   ```

   ```bash
   # 3. Run the script (ensure that you are already authenticated with the az cli through "az login")
   python3 azure_resource_graph_collector.py
   ```
